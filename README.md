WordPress Examples
===========
The purpose of this repository is to provide some example WordPress code. But to do that without making one giant theme that has a lot of stuff in it. So each example is in its own folder. 

The master branch contains all of the folders. You can fork/download that to get everything.

Each example is also in its own branch and release so you can download just the files for that example if you like.
