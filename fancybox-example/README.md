## Acknowledgements
This code uses fancybox: [http://fancyapps.com/fancybox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox)

It is modified from this Tuts+ tutorial: [http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/add-a-responsive-lightbox-to-your-wordpress-theme--wp-28100](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/add-a-responsive-lightbox-to-your-wordpress-theme--wp-28100)

The files mostly from the tutorial are:

* fancybox-wp-init
* and the add fancybox function in functions.php

## Instructions

0. Copy the fancybox folder into your theme
1. Open functions.php and copy the lines indicated
2. Paste those lines into your functions.php
3. Visit a post with image thumbnails (or create one, galleries are the easiest way) and watch the magic.

## Notes
When you're creating a gallery make sure to choose the file as the link (not attachment). An example of the kind of shortcode you should have is:
`[gallery link="file" columns="2" ids="219,217,143,133"]`
